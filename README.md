Tally Bot 

## About
Within modern retail stores and supermarkets, it is an overall priority for the company to increase revenue and efficiency of the store while still upholding a positive consumer experience. Companies therefore, are looking to specifically employ new robotic systems from self checkout to inventory robots with the overall priority to reduce workloads, increase stock accuracy, eliminate human errors and enhance the stores marketing opportunities. 

This project will highlight the critical aspects of the tally bot project.

## Overview

In modern retail stores and supermarkets, increasing revenue and operational efficiency while maintaining a positive consumer experience is paramount. TallyBot addresses these goals by automating inventory checks, thereby reducing workloads, eliminating human errors, and enhancing marketing opportunities through accurate stock data.

## Features

- **Autonomous Navigation**: Capable of navigating store aisles to perform inventory checks without human intervention.
- **Real-Time Stock Monitoring**: Continuously monitors stock levels and identifies discrepancies.
- **User Interface**: Provides an interface for staff to interact with the system and access inventory data.
- **Data Logging**: Records inventory data for analysis and reporting purposes.

## System Architecture

The TallyBot system comprises the following components:

- **Hardware**: Includes sensors and actuators necessary for navigation and data collection.
- **Software**:
  - `User_Interface.cpp`: Manages the user interface for interacting with TallyBot.
  - `tally_bot/`: Contains the core logic for navigation and inventory management.
  - `SamplePackage/`: Provides sample implementations and testing modules.
- **Documentation**:
  - `Tally Bot Major Project Report.pdf`: Detailed report outlining the project's objectives, methodology, and findings.
  - `UML Diagram.png`: Visual representation of the system's architecture.
  - `Item.png` and `Shelf.png`: Images used for reference in inventory identification.
